## Summary
We find a cave and sign which leads us to believe that Gundrin and his companions were takin prisoner. We enter free some Wolves, kill some goblins and find the prisoners. We end up killing the Goblin captan Yesik but before that he tells us that Clarg is big and bad and is behind their actions. After killing most of the goblins we have one lowly goblin Grumby who says Clarg is deeper in the cave but he was never allowed near where Clarg is. ^summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

Starting after the goblin ambush:

- Only 1 goblin is left which is what I'm chasing. I lose the goblin so come back to the group
- We investigate the ambushed people and assume they were adventures like us.
	- I can't find anything to bury the dead so I burn them in a funeral pyre
	- the 3 humans we assume where Gundrins human companions
	- We see sign of two being dragged away (we assum Gundrin and his companion sylvy)
- We follow the trail of the fleeing goblin and come to a stream coming out of a cave
	- We decide to enter the cave
	- We start hearing what aery suspects are wolves in distress
	- we come up to a split in the trail and to the right is where we hear the sound of the wolves
	- we see 3 wolves chained to the wall
		- aery tries to calm them down with animal handling
		- Fiona tosses them some handfulls of food goes around behind them and sees a hole above where it appears the goblins were tossing down food
		- Aery frees them and they run out of the cave
	- We start heading up the cave when we see a bridge crossing above us and 1 goblin sentry
		- We surprise the sentry - kill it
		- Puss climbs up and drops a rope and we climb up to the rope bridge. 
		- We proceed to the right heading to the hole above the wolf den
		- We see an open area with 3 goblins and some pools that looked dammed off
		- We bavktrack and explore to the left of the bridge where we find a large barracks type room. The goblin captain #yesik is in there along with 5 other goblins and 2 of them are beating on a human
		- Yesik is captain  says #Clarg is bad. Yesik tried to bargain. I told him to release the prisoner and we would help him with Clarg. He refused so I rushed in and killed him.
		- the last goblin is alive, I intimidate him. He says clarg is bad and clarg is further in the cave. Someone as low as grumby is not allowed where clarg is.
